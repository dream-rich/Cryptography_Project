# One Time Password (OTP) Based on Advanced Encrypted Standard (AES) and Linear Congruential Generator(LCG)

## Abstract
In modern times, safeguarding user accounts with double-factor authentication has become imperative due to the increasing number of cyber attacks. `One Time Password (OTP)` is a type of double-factor authentication that is valid for only one login session, making it a more secure way to protect user accounts.

In this study, an `OTP` was generated by utilizing a combination of the user's login, phone number, and time of access. The plaintext was encrypted using `Advanced Encryption Standard (AES)`, which is a widely-used encryption algorithm that provides a high level of security. The encrypted data was then processed by a `Linear Congruential Generator (LCG)`, which randomly selected 6 characters to generate the `OTP`.

The research findings indicate that the `OTP` generated by `LCG` is unique and unpredictable, making it resistant to repeated usage and sniffing attacks. This proposed method of `OTP` generation offers added protection to user accounts by providing a more secure way to authenticate users.

It's worth noting that while `OTPs` can add an additional layer of security to user accounts, they are not foolproof and can still be vulnerable to attacks. For instance, if an attacker gains access to the user's phone or email account, they can intercept the `OTP` and use it to gain access to the user's account. Therefore, it's crucial to combine `OTP` with other security measures, such as password managers, firewalls, and antivirus software, to provide comprehensive protection against cyber attacks.

## Scenario
In this scenario, accessing a social network account requires the use of a static password for studying and working purposes. However, a static password is considered insecure as it remains unchanged for every login attempt, failing to recognize the actual account owner and making it vulnerable to hacker attacks. To address this issue, `OTP` has been developed as a security code that can only be used once for a login attempt, thereby reducing the risk of fraudulent attempts and ensuring maximum security.

`OTP` can be generated using various methods such as **time-based**, **counter-based**, or **challenge-response-based** algorithms. One popular method is the `Time-based One Time Password (TOTP)` algorithm that generates a **six-digit** code based on the current time and a secret key shared between the server and the user's device.

The level of confidentiality of the information is proportional to the complexity of the `OTP` generation algorithm. A more complex algorithm, such as `TOTP`, provides a higher level of security as it uses a combination of a secret key and the current time to generate a unique code for every login attempt.

It's important to note that while `OTPs` can add an additional layer of security to user accounts, they are not foolproof and can still be vulnerable to attacks. For example, an attacker can intercept the `OTP` if they gain access to the user's phone or email account. Therefore, it's crucial to combine `OTP` with other security measures, such as password managers, firewalls, and antivirus software, to provide comprehensive protection against cyber attacks.

## Solution
To address the mentioned issue of static passwords being insecure, it is essential to implement **two-factor** authentication, which requires the user to provide two forms of identification, such as a password and a `OTP`. This can be achieved by utilizing a blend of two techniques, `AES` and `LCG`, for the generation of `OTPs` to enhance security.

`AES` is a **widely-used** encryption algorithm that uses a symmetric key to encrypt and decrypt data. In the proposed method, `AES` is used to encrypt a counter value that is incremented for each new `OTP`, ensuring that each `OTP` is unique and unpredictable. This makes it resistant to repeated usage and sniffing attacks.

On the other hand, `LCG` is a type of pseudorandom number generator that uses a linear equation to generate a sequence of random numbers. In the proposed method, `LCG` is used to generate the seed for the `AES` counter. The seed is derived from a combination of the user's login, phone number, and time of access, ensuring that it is unique for each login attempt.
