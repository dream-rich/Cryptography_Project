# One Time Password (OTP) Based on Advanced Encrypted Standard (AES) and Linear Congruential Generator(LCG)

# Abstract
In modern times, safeguarding user accounts with double-factor authentication has become imperative. One Time Password (OTP) is a type of double-factor authentication that is valid for only one login session. In this study, an OTP was generated by utilizing a combination of the user's login, phone number, and time of access. The plaintext was encrypted using Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) before a Linear Congruential Generator (LCG) randomly selected 6 characters. The research findings indicate that the OTP generated by LCG is unique and unpredictable, making it resistant to repeated usage and sniffing attacks. This proposed method of OTP generation offers added protection to user accounts.

# Scenario
In this scenario, accessing a social network account requires the use of a static password for studying and working purposes. Nevertheless, a static password is considered insecure as it remains unchanged for every login attempt, failing to recognize the actual account owner and making it vulnerable to hacker attacks. To address this issue, One Time Password (OTP) has been developed as a security code that can only be used once for a login attempt, thereby reducing the risk of fraudulent attempts and ensuring maximum security. The level of confidentiality of the information is proportional to the complexity of the OTP generation algorithm.

# Solution
In order to address the mentioned issue, it is essential to implement two-factor authentication. This can be achieved by utilizing a blend of two techniques, Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) and Linear Congruential Generator (LCG), for the generation of one-time passwords (OTPs) to enhance security. AES is used to encrypt a counter value that is incremented for each new OTP, while LCG is used to generate the seed for the AES counter. The figure below show how this proposed method work.
